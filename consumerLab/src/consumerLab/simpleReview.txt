I looked down at my feet. My fresh white Airs were about to get as crumpled and brown at the seams as my dad’s. We won the game, and I wiped them down as best I could before my date with Nay Nay, which led to multiple dates, which led to nothing, because she was using high school me to make her 20-something-year-old boyfriend jealous. I never got that Foot Locker job, or any other job in a shoe store, either. But I discovered my connection with Airs, just as my dad, big brother and older guys in the neighborhood did before me. I’m from a place where nothing is permanent — not housing, not family, not freedom — and yet these shoes have always been there: the one sneaker I can hoop in, wear on a date or to a job interview. Twenty years later, and they’re still a part of my uniform.
