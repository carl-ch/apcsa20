I feel I was given 1 real authentic shoe and one fake . the material in left shoe is far less dense and more pliable and softer then the right shoe.. Left shoe after 8 hours of standing as a graveyard shift gas station worker creased up so *horrible it seems as thought I've spent the shoe a year. Right shoe is *perfect no creases , it's been 1 day of ownership and 8 hours of usage in a store . and I am upset to of paged 120 dollars for this horrible purchase . I've purchased reboks and vans from foot locker lasted longer then 2 weeks without show of creases for 40,60 dollar shoes and 75 dollar DC stags... I am from LA California I was rocking air force ones when they came out and this left shoe is 100% questionable...
